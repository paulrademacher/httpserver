response code strings in static map

Class App instead of Server (multiple apps per server)

max length on buffer read in http headers

File layout (src dir, examples dir, etc)

Implement chaining of >> operator for routes?  (is that useful?)

Move the creation entirely inside Transaction, to better future-proof against accidental
deletion of socket

RoutePtr has a RouteSharedPtr, but does not follow same pattern of ownership as Transaction, etc

Opportunity for pattern instead of op_started() / op_ended()

Opportunity for pattern around main.cpp's usage of async_wait, which is a clunky closure

Transactions could be a unique_ptr with explicit mem mgmt
